# DTR: Define the Relationship

## Project: Book Club - Module 2 Pairing Project

### Group Member Names: Matt Levy & Vince Provenzano

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
- We are both aiming for completion, not perfection. We would like aim for 3s in every category and maybe a couple 4s if time allows.
- Vince wants to move at my pace since he's already done the project.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
- Vince: routing and logic
- We want to setup the basic structure of the project together but then break up user stories to divide and conquer where possible.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
- Help each other when needed

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
- Matt: Thursday, 3/21 afternoon, I planned to go to the DMV to get a new drivers license. Flexible other days.
- Vince: Flexible schedule most evenings, might be busy during weekends to help family
- Tentative schedule: Meet Tuesday afternoon and Friday afternoon.  Other days as needed.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
- Slack, check-in daily at lunch
- Don't merge your own pull request, send a Slack message to let the other person know that something needs reviewed.
- Keep an eye on the Waffle board

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
- Both of us want to improve on our CSS skills, try to style frequently instead of leaving it all to the end.
- Both of us want to improve our ActiveRecord skills
- Matt wants to get better at workflow management via Waffle

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
- TBD
- Divide stories up as we go

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
- We want to review each other's pull requests before merging
- Commit frequently
- Work on branches, keep pull requests limited to one user-story/one piece of functionality

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

- Preferably in person if crucial conversations are needed

Project management tools we will use:
